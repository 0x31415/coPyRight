# coPyRight

This small tool allows one to quickly add copyright information in an arborescence
of files. 

It only asks to modify/add copyrights commented template for each needed
programming languages (in this exemple Python and C++ are provided). Adding language
will ask to add case in the copyrighter.py file which is pretty straightforward.

#### Usage

foo@bar:~$ ./main.py /path/to/folder/
```
